          	  <h2>The eTRANSAFE project</h2>
              <p>The Enhancing TRANslational SAFEty Assessment through Integrative Knowledge Management (eTRANSAFE) project develops an integrative data infrastructure and innovative 
              computational methods and tools that aim to drastically improve the feasibility and reliability of translational safety assessment during the drug development process. 
              This infrastructure will be underpinned by development of open standards and robust policies widely accepted by stakeholders, including regulatory agencies and international organisations.</p>
              <p>The eTRANSAFE is a five-year project, starting from 1st September of 2017, funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (IMI 2) together with the pharmaceutical industry, 
              that aims to develop an advanced data integration infrastructure together with innovative computational methods to improve the security in drug development process.</p>

          	  <h2>Platform for sharing toxicology reports </h2>
              <p>The WP5 on Data Interoperability & integration includes task 5.3, which focuses on Textual Data Integration Services. This task provides the necessary mechanisms for knowledge  extraction  
              from unstructured data e.g. reports, literature, patents, among others. This task also includes document management and pre-processing, access to vocabularies, classification dictionaries and entity recognition infrastructure. To facilitate sharing toxicological reports and other data among eTRANSAFE partners, we have prepared a secure platform to that end. 
              Sharing data is essential to construct common datasets, which are used to extract knowledge, validate analysis pipelines and even benchmark their performance.
